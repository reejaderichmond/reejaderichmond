## Hi there 👋

👋 **I’m @reejaderichmond**__ aka ReeJade Richmond.

👀 **What I'm focused on:** I’m interested in building systems that empower everyday professionals to step into tech with clarity—not chaos. I live at the intersection of business analysis, data, and product thinking, and I’m obsessed with helping people execute—not just “get inspired.”

🌱 **What I am working on:** I’m currently learning how to scale curriculum systems for adult learners navigating career pivots—and digging deeper into data tools, AI integration, and product-led strategy.

💞️ **What I want to collaborate on:** I’m looking to collaborate on execution-first learning experiences, real-world tech curriculum, and tools that make growth tangible for 9-to-5ers transitioning into Business Analysis, Data Analysis, or Product Management.

⚡ **Fun fact:**
I was diagnosed with kidney disease in my early 20s and spent years on dialysis while navigating law school. I thought law was the path—until I realized I was more obsessed with building systems than debating case law.
So I pivoted. Taught myself how to build websites. Fell in love with data. Started applying business strategy through tech.

_Today, I use my corporate career in strategy, analytics, and product to teach working professionals how to pivot into tech roles—without fluff, without confusion, and without losing who they are._****
